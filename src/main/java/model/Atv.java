 * Movement behavior:
 * o Trucks travel only on streets and through lights and crosswalks.
 * o Trucks randomly select to go straight, turn left, or turn right.  As a last resort, if none of these three
 * directions is legal (all not streets, lights, or crosswalks), the truck turns around.
 * o Trucks drive through all traffic lights without stopping!
 * o Trucks  stop  for  red  crosswalk  lights  but  drive  through  yellow  or  green  crosswalk  lights  without
 * stopping.
 * â€¢ Collision behavior: A truck survives a collision with anything, living or dead.
